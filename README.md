# George Langham's portfolio site

Feel like translating a plain HTML template into Gatsby for this one.

Was thinking of going for a Card-based design, something with the main page being just details, and the second page as a blog/portfolio with posts, and the final with a simple contact form and some social links (probably only LinkedIn and maybe the vetted professional Twitter account.)

## Start developing.

Navigate into your new site's directory, install node modules, and start it up.

1. `cd YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`
1. `npm install`
1. `gatsby develop`
1. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._


## Creating Posts

1. Login to CMS (using NetlifyCMS)
2. Create and preview post
3. publish and wait for build to complete
