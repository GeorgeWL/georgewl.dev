## Start developing.

Navigate into your new site's directory, install node modules, and start it up.

1. `cd YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`
1. `npm install`
1. `gatsby develop`

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
